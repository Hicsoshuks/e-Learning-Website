	<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	<p>First, cut pieces from the foam to make the shape of your paw around your shoe. I'm making hooves so I carved the cloven hoof and tested it with my fursuit legs 
	to make sure it was the right shape.</p> 
	<br>
	<img src="test.jpg" alt="test" width="350px" height="300px">
	<br>
	<p>Build on it, carve and smooth the foam until you're happy with it, then hot glue it to the shoe. Make sure it's very firmly attached, you don't want your shoes 
	falling apart.</p>
	<br>
	<img src="glued.jpg" alt="glued" width="350px" height="300px">
	<p>When you're happy with the shape, cover it in duct tape. <b>You can't change the shape after adding duct tape</b> Put the tape everywhere you want the fabric to go, 
	as this makes the pattern.</p>
	<img src="taped.jpg" alt="taped" width="350px" height="300px">
	<br>
	<p>If your paw has several colours, draw on the duct tape where the markings of your paw go.</p>
	<br>
	<p>Now, draw on your pattern pieces. You want to make them fairly flat.</p>
	<br>
	<p>Next, label your pieces. There are different ways to do this. I label mine with a letter representing the colour (P means purple,) a number indicating which piece 
	it is (P5 means the fifth purple piece,) and an arrow indicating which way the fur goes. Keep in mind it should run down the leg.</p>
	<br>
	<img src="pieces_on_tape.jpg" alt="Drawn on tape" width="350px" height="300px">
	<br>
	<p>Cut out a pattern piece from the duct tape. Stick it onto the newspaper, making sure it is kept flat. On the now exposed foam, draw where the piece used to be and label it. 
	Continue this process until you have all your duct tape as pieces on the newspaper and your foam paw marked with the placement of all the pieces.</p>
	<br>

	<img src="tape_newspaper.jpg" alt="Tape pieces stuck to newspaper" width="350px" height="300px">
	<br>
	<p>Cut out all your newspaper/duct tape pattern pieces, adding Â½ cm around the edge as seam allowance. Seam allowance is adding a bit of room for sewing.</p>
	<br>
	<img src="paper_piece.jpg" alt="Cut paper piece" width="350px" height="300px">
	<br>
	<p>Because you will be cutting the back of the fur, turn over your pattern pieces so the newspaper side is facing up. 
	Re-label the pieces, ensuring you keep the direction of the fur (the arrows you drew) the right way.</p>
	<br>
	<img src="paper_side.jpg" alt="Other side of piece" width="350px" height="300px">
	<br>
	<p>Transfer the pattern pieces to the fur, labelling them as you go.</p>
	<br>
	<img src="drawn_on_fur.jpg" alt="Pattern drawn on fur" width="350px" height="300px">
	<br>
	<p>Cut out your fur pieces using the knife, be very careful not to cut the fur fibres, only the backing of the fabric. 
	Make sure the cutting mat is under the fur so you cut onto it and not your table.</p>
	<br>
	<p>Next, sew you fur pieces together. Make sure you don't catch any fur in the seams. Sew them right sides together (furry sides together.) 
	Make sure you double check which piece connects to which and how they fit. It's better to spend some more time checking you have it right than rushing and having to unpick it. Leave the back of the foot open to make it easier to slip onto the shoe.</p>
	<br>
	<p>You should have a fabric case for the shoe with the furry side inwards. Turn it so the fur is facing out like it should be. 
	Comb out any fur that got caught in the seams and check for holes. Mend any holes.</p>
	<br>
	<p>Carefully slip the fabric onto the foam shoe. Once it's all fitted properly, glue the back of the shoe closed.</p>

	<br>
	<p>Finish the rough edge with a piece of scrap fabric.</p>

	<p>Enjoy your new, handmade paws!</p>
