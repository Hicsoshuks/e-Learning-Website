	<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	<br>	
	<p>First you will need to find the nap of your fabric. 
	The nap means which direction the fur runs.</p>
	<br>
	<img src="nap.png" alt="nap" width="300px" height="300px">
	<br>
	<p>Turn over your faux fur to the wrong side (the side that isn't furry) 
	and mark the nap with an arrow. Transfer your tail design to the fabric with a fabric marker or chalk.</p>
	<br>
	<p>Cut out your tail pieces using the knife, be very careful not to cut the fur fibres, only the backing of the fabric. 
	Make sure the cutting mat is under the fur so you cut onto it and not your table.</p>
	<br>
	<p>Line up the two matching pieces, with the furry sides together, and pin and sew the two pieces together. 
	Ensure that no fur is poking through the seams. Leave the top end of the tail open.</p>
	<br>
	<p>You should now have a kind of big furry sock with the fur on the inside. Turn it right side out so the fur is on the outside.</p>
	<br>
	<p>Comb the fur out of the seams (places where two pieces are stitched together) if there is any fur caught in the seams.</p>
	<br>
	<p>Check if there are any holes in the tail. If you find any, mend them.</p>
	<br>
	<p>Stuff the tail. If you stuff it lightly, it will be softer and squishier. If you stuff it more firmly it will hold its shape better but will be harder.</p>
	<br>
	<p>Cut two circles of upholstery foam, one with a slightly larger diameter than the tail opening and one slightly smaller than the first.</p>
	<br>
	<img src="foam_circles.png" alt="foam pieces" width="300px" height="300px">
	<br>
	<p>Trim the edges of the circles to smooth them off. Put the smaller circle in the tail and the larger one in on top of it. This will make the tail look more realistic 
	by sticking out and not flopping all over your legs and getting in the way as you walk.</p>
	<br>
	<p>When you're happy with the shape of your tail, hand sew the top of it closed over the foam circles. You could also glue it if you don't like hand sewing.</p>
	<br>
	<p>Cut two belt loops of elastic. Be careful to position them correctly on the tail, then glue and/or sew them in place.</p>
	<br>

	<p>Enjoy your new, handmade tail!</p>
